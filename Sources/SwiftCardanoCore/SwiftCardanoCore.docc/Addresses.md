# Addresses

The `Address` module provides types and functions for working with Cardano addresses.

## Overview

In the Shelley era and beyond, Cardano addresses are generated by applying a blake2b-256 hash to verification (public) keys. For a deeper understanding, refer to Cardano’s official documentation on address structures.

Address generation also depends on the network type—either mainnet or testnet—which must be specified when creating an address.

The Base Address is the most widely used format. It is derived from a payment verification key and a stake verification key, ensuring a secure and structured approach to handling Cardano transactions.

```swift
import SwiftCardanoCore

let paymentSKey = try PaymentSigningKey.generate()
let paymentVKey: PaymentVerificationKey = try PaymentVerificationKey.fromSigningKey(sk)


let stakeSKey = try StakeSigningKey.generate()
let stakeVKey: StakeVerificationKey = try StakeVerificationKey.fromSigningKey(sk)

let address = try Address(paymentPart: .verificationKeyHash(try paymentVKey.hash()), stakePart: .verificationKeyHash(try stakeVKey.hash()), network: .testnet)
```

```swift
import SwiftCardanoCore

let address = try Address(from: "addr_test1vr2p8st5t5cxqglyjky7vk98k7jtfhdpvhl4e97cezuhn0cqcexl7")
```
